Prague is one of the most popular cities in Europe with many outstanding views and historic, exciting structures. My journey to Prague has started with the hiring of my wife by a global company there. In this study, I give a brief insight about the population, house prices and types by comparing municipal parts of the city for anyone to buy a property in Prague or interested in the real estate industry. I'll go over these steps;

- Observe the municipal parts of Prague
- Population distribution by municipal parts
- House prices by municipal parts
- Number of different types of venues inside 1km radius of the center of municipal parts
- Cluster municipal parts of Prague.
